# Heritage Quest: Explore Kuala Lumpur Meaningfully

## Project Description

Tourism in Kuala Lumpur is often centered around malls and cafes, leaving Malaysia's rich cultural heritage underexplored. Existing platforms lack engagement and rarely promote eco-friendly travel habits.

JomMalaysia is a web app that gamifies city exploration for tourists and locals. Users discover cultural sites, heritage food spots, and hidden gems through an interactive map - earning points, achievements, and badges for verified visits and eco-conscious choices.
